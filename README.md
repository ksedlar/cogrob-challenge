# cogrob-challenge
A repository of ROS packages for MIT 16.412 Grand Challenge 2018.

A VM for this course was provided, with the following environment:
* ROS Kinetic Kame
* Ubuntu 16.04
* Turtlebot3
* Python 2.7

This repository is intended to be cloned into an existing catkin workspace (~/catkin_ws/src/).

To learn more about catkin, ROS packages, and more, we invite the user to check out various tutorials:
* [Catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/Tutorials)
* [ROS Packages](http://wiki.ros.org/Packages)
* [Writing a Publsher and Subscriber](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/WritingPublisherSubscriber%28python%29)

To launch nodes in one of these packages, you can perform the following:

```roslaunch package-name file.launch```


We provide three packages here: active-SLAM, science-mapping, and testing-metrics.
